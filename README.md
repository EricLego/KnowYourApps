# Mood Insights App - User Guide (Phase 1)
Welcome to Mood Insights, your companion for understanding how your digital habits may influence your mood and well-being.

## What Does the App Do?
Mood Insights helps you:

Track how much time you spend on your phone and which apps you use most.

Categorize your app usage (like social, productivity, or entertainment).

Analyze your interaction patterns (how often you switch apps, how actively you use them).

Use smart AI to spot patterns and predict how your digital habits might be affecting your mood.

## How It Works
1. Screen Time & App Tracking
The app automatically records how long you use your phone and each app.

It groups apps into categories (like Social, Productivity, Entertainment) so you can see where your time goes.

You can review your daily and weekly usage, and even adjust categories if something doesn’t feel right.

2. Interaction Analysis
We look at how you use your phone-such as how often you unlock it, switch apps, or actively type and scroll.

This helps us understand not just what you use, but how you use it.

3. Mood Prediction (AI-Powered)
Our AI combines your app usage and interaction patterns to estimate how your habits might be linked to your mood.

You’ll get simple mood insights and suggestions (for example, “Late-night social scrolling is linked to lower mood for you. Consider a digital wind-down!”).

## Privacy & Security
Your data stays on your device by default-nothing is shared without your permission.

You control what is tracked and can pause or delete your data anytime.

We do not sell or share your personal information.

## Getting Started
Install the app and follow the setup prompts.

Allow permissions for screen time and app usage tracking (we’ll guide you).

Check your dashboard after a day or two for your first insights.

Adjust app categories if needed for more personalized results.

## FAQs

A: Yes! You can pause tracking or delete your data anytime from the settings.

Q: Is my data secure?
A: Absolutely. All your data is encrypted and stored safely on your device.
